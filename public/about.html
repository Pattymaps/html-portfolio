<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Patricia Sekai Mapimbiro and I am currently learning to code. This is my first website which I am currently designing using the fundamental basics of html. I just started my career journey in the field of web development and I am so excited to explore the entire Full Stack Web Developer course which consists of subjects like JavaScript, React, Node JS, Mongo DB and so many more. Hyperion Dev is the institute with which I am studying with and it is offering support and assistance toward this new journey into the tech world.</p>
<p>My goal is to acquire as much knowledge as possible, show off my skills so i can be able to get opportunities in various companies in order to retain good quality work experience. In the next few years, I can see myself growing in web development skills and abilities. I believe that having attained expertise in this field, i will be able to deliver good quality techniques and dexterity thus becoming valuable in the industry. </p>
